Hi Jason

I bought your book. Loving it although when deploying to Heroku through mac terminal after login in successfully and creating app, I get an error when running "git push heroku master"

Error returned below:

it seems like remote: -----> Failed to detect set buildpack https://github.com/jasonswett/heroku-buildpack-nodej failed please check your side or advise to what I could of missed. All new to me.

I also installed exactly what your versions were:

Git 2.7.4
Node 6.9.1
NPM 3.10.8
Ruby 2.3.1
Rails 5.0.0.1
Heroku CLI

Thanks for your reply in advance.
