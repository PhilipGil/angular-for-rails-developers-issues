# Angular for Rails Developers: Issues

I created this repo to more easily keep track of issues (or improvement ideas) for [Angular for Rails Developers](https://www.angularonrails.com/angular-rails-developers/).

If you have a problem or idea, please create an issue in this repo.

If you need to get a hold of me (Jason Swett, author of Angular for Rails Developers), you can email me at jason@angularonrails.com.
