# Angular for Rails Developers: Issues

I created this repo to more easily keep track of issues (or improvement ideas) for [Angular for Rails Developers](https://www.angularonrails.com/angular-rails-developers/).

If you have a problem or idea, please create an issue in this repo.

If you need to get a hold of me (Jason Swett, author of Angular for Rails Developers), you can email me at jason@angularonrails.com.

*Important note*: if you're having a technical challenge that's not related to an error or omission in the book, please don't create an issue here. Instead, create a Stack Overflow question and email a link to me at jason@angularonrails.com. That said, if you miss this note and post a question about your unique technical problem here anyway, I'll still try to help you.
